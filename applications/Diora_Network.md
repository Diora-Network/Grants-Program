# Open Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Diora Network.
- **Team Name:** Diora Labs.
- **Payment Address:** 0xe782fE6487d55904244A955775da4662220Bb2AB (USDT).

## Project Overview

### Overview

Diora Network is a public EVM-compatible parachain for the Dotsama ecosystem. We are hoping to realize 2000+ TPS utilizing advanced PoSM with Double Validation & Randomization for security guarantees.

Diora Network proposes the Proof of Stake Masternode (PoSM) consensus, which is a PoS based blockchain protocol with a fair voting mechanism, rigorous security guarantees, and uniform probability eventually. The consensus has the following key novelties:

- Double Validation to strengthen security and reduce forking
- Randomization to guarantee the fair and prevent handshaking attacks
- Fast confirmation time and efficient checkpoints for finality or re-base

Blockchain technology is rapidly changing the world as we know it, but public and private blockchain networks are mostly still operating in isolation. Decentralized finance must be connected. Polkadot is enabling financial freedom, empowerment and connectivity that we’ve never experienced in history. We seek to accelerate this change through global connectivity, simple to use dApps & making decentralized finance accessible to anyone around the world with a internet connection.


### Project Details

The backbone of Diora's products and ecosystem is the Diora blockchain, with its innovative Proof of Stake Masternode (PoSM) consensus. PoSM not only increases the performance and security of blockchain, but also reduces the fork risk in an efficient and practical manner.

To facilitate interactions between users (including Stakers and Masternode owners and the Diora blockchain, 
a set of products have been actively being developed, including DioraScan, DioraMaster (GOV), DioraDex, Diora Wallets, EVM & Substrate Token Bridges and testnet faucets.
These products will be continuously improved in our long-term plan.

Furthermore, more highly innovative pallets and technologies from other top EVM based Polkadot Parachains such as Moonbeam, Acala, Astar & Parrell will be intensively researched and implemented to make Diora become an ideal fit for open finance, games and enterprise-oriented applications within the Dotsama Ecosystem 


### Use Cases

Decentralized / Open Finance
Diora relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with Proof of Stake Masternode (PoSM) consensus that can support low transaction fees and fast transaction confirmation times. Security, stability and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts and true randomization processes.

EVM Compatible
Diora supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and cross-chain token bridges meaning any EVM Dapp can easily be migrated to Diora. New scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into Diora's Masternode architecture. It will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances and token integrations for small and big businesses.

Gaming Networks
Historically, games have been run by companies who control the supply and sale of in-game currencies as well as digital assets and collectibles. Users do not own the assets they buy or win on traditional gaming platforms. Blockchain offers us a credible way of enabling users to take control of their assets for ownership and trade. Diora can help increase the efficiency of performing transactions of gaming networks over a blockchain. Transactions such as buying or selling in-game currencies and buying and digital assets can be significantly sped up.

Payments
Integrate DeFi Payments on your Dapps with a few simple steps. Settle payments on-chain whenever needed. Payment transactions on Diora can be confirmed in sub-seconds due to faster block generation times while incurring significantly lower fees. Make payments smoother and friction-free for users on your Dapps. Diora provides payment APIs/SDKs for Dapps, merchant, and users to instantly accept or pay in crypto assets like ERC20 tokens.

Lending & Credit scoring platform
Diora will enable a platform for merchants to assess the creditworthiness of connected users via their transaction history. This enables merchants to lend tokens to users on the network when transacting with users that do not have sufficient funds.

Identity
Decentralized apps need a way to sign transactions, but that must happen without submitting private keys on each Dapp. Through an Open-Identity system, Diora makes sure users have control over their private keys without worrying about their security.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0. | PoSM Substrate  | a PoW/PoS hybrid consensus protocol, we apply PoSM with voting and Double Validation to create, verify and vote for blocks smoothly and efficiently. Whenever potentials of fork branches are detected, we employ the idea in PoW to select the longest branch with the most votes and discard the other branches. With this hybrid approach, PoSM does not only increase the performance and security of blockchain, but also reduce the fork situation in an efficient and practical manner. DPoS is similar to PoSM in the sense that masternodes (block creators or witnesses in DPoS) are elected through a voting system. However, Diora requires that masternodes need to deposit a required minimum amount of DIOR to become a masternode candidate, which puts more pressure on the masternodes to work honestly. Furthermore, the Double Validation mechanism lowers the probability of handshaking attacks and having invalid blocks. With a maximum of 150 masternodes elected (and this number of masternodes can be changed based on the decentralized governance through voting)  |
